# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, designed to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills. The goal is to build a simple recipe website that consists of an index page linking to multiple recipe pages.

## Features
- **HTML Structure**: The website is built using fundamental HTML elements, including headings, lists, links, and images.
- **CSS Styling**: A custom CSS stylesheet is used to style the webpage, including a vintage "old paper" effect for the recipe cards.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts based on screen size to enhance user experience.
- **GitHub Hosting**: The website is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
- Transparent Textures for paper effects
